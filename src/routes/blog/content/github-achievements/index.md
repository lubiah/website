I have always used GitHub since I first started coding. Almost every developer on the planet uses Github for something. The benefit of using it is that it simplifies version control. Every developer understands the value of version control, and GitHub makes our lives easier. I won't benefits of using GitHub, so let me get right to the point.

## History of GitHub achievements

So let me tell you the story of Github's achievements.
Last year, in 2021, NASA and [Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL)](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) launched the first Mars helicopter into the Martian atmosphere. The helicopter was built with open-source software. GitHub decided to add badges to the profiles of every developer who contributed to specific versions of any open-source projects and libraries used by Ingenuity, the helicopter.
GitHub achievements were created to recognise the efforts of these developers.

The image above depicts the first-ever GitHub achievement badge. It was exciting to see some developers with these badges. Simply seeing a developer with one of these badges meant he had contributed to something great, like a seasoned pro. This badge was released alongside two others.
The "Artic Code Vault" badge, as well as a badge for those who sponsor open-source projects through Github sponsors.

The point is that these badges were valuable and difficult to obtain. Only the worthy possessed them, and to be awarded any of these badges, one had to work hard or accomplish something extraordinary.
They were difficult to obtain, making it worthwhile to fight for them. I wanted one of those badges back then, but I knew I had to do something deserving to get one.
Then my dreams came true, but not in the way I had hoped.

## The new GitHub Achievements and why I hate it

GitHub released a beta version of its achievements section just two days ago, and it sucks. It distributes badges unnecessarily.

The idea of GitHub introducing a new set of badges is fantastic, but how the badges are distributed or awarded is disastrous.
Let us begin with the first badge.

1. **YOLO**
   This is the badge you get for making a pull request. Though the badge is fantastic, let me tell you what it lacks. You can earn this badge by simply submitting a pull request to your repository. See what I mean? It stinks, and there's no reason to earn a badge for it. What is the point of a user always wanting to merge his pull request?

2. **Pull Shark**
   It is, as the name implies, a badge that you receive when your pull requests are merged. It's a fantastic badge, but you can also award it to yourself.

The fact that you can award yourself these badges negates the entire point of achievement. What is the point of rewarding yourself with something? Almost every developer will have these badges as a result of this. Nothing distinguishes them any longer. I've seen a few developers receive these badges, and it's really sad to see that the majority of them just made some commits in their repositories and received this badge. "The more rare, the better." Something is worth fighting for when it is extremely difficult to obtain or earn.

## Conclusion

What I suggest is that GitHub should retake another strategy as to how they award their achievements.
